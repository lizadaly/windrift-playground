                    do not unhand you, and you‘re forced bodily into the time machine. They slam the
                    heavy door shut, and spin the locking mechanism with a certain amount of flair.
                    Their cheering is muffled but audible, and then you hear the sound of receding
                    footsteps followed by silence.

                    The entire edifice has ceased shaking. Smoke rises from every crack and gap in

                                glows brighter above you than you've ever seen before, and the
                                constellations are unfamiliar. Streaks of blue and pink light
                                criss-cross the night sky, traveling with purpose. You are alone

                                of your grand machine, and begin to walk towards whatever this
                                strange far future holds.
